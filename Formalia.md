You must upload a .zip file to WISEflow containing:

(1) A PDF file with:

**A link to your Unity project on GitHub (make sure itâ€™s a public repository).**

- The GitHub commit messages are used to determine the contributions of each team member. If the commit messages in any way do not reflect the correct distribution of work, this must be addressed in a seperate section of the PDF, including the correct contributions for each team member. In either case, you must include a section in the PDF mapping GitHub usernames with full name and student number.
- Attach a README to the GitHub repository that contains:
    - A link to a YouTube video demonstration of your game (~2min)
    - Sources of any third party assets/code (this includes any tutorials that you have followed)
    - Optionally, a link to a playable WebGL build of your game, hosted on GitHub Pages

**~2 pages (one page is 2400 characters, including spaces) per group member of individual reflections on your contributions to the project.**
- Being concrete and referencing specific code sections is highly encouraged (as are using figures and illustrations, but neither code snippets, figures or illustrations count towards the page limit).

(2) A copy of the source code of your project (avoid including temporary files and build artifacts)
