# theGame

## Project Overview

You must **develop a game** during the semester.
Your **GMD grade** is based on this project.
The game must be **developed in groups of 1-4 people**.
**You decide** what type of game to makeExpected workload: **70 hours per student**

## Project Assessment

When we assess your game, we will look at:

- The **scope/ambition** of the game
- That you can demonstrate **ownership** of the implementation in your reflections
- That the game covers the **learning goals** of the course
- That the **source code is well-structured**
- That the game is fully playable (it doesn’t have to be “bug-free”)
- That it is **YOUR game** (not simply a copy/paste of a tutorial or a list of downloaded assets from the asset store)

## Remember to Include...

- [ ] Scripting (e.g. monobehaviours, coroutines, events)
- [ ] Input & Vectors (e.g. input systems, manipulating transforms)
- [ ] Physics (e.g. rigidbodies, colliders, triggers)
- [ ] Graphics & Audio (e.g. models, shaders, audio clips)Animation (e.g. animators, animations)
- [ ] Game Architecture (e.g. game managers, ScriptableObjects, SOLID principles)
- [ ] Game AI (e.g. finite-state machines, navmesh agents, pathfinding algorithms)
- [ ] User Interface (e.g. menus and HUD)

## Handing In

A **public link** to the project repository (as pdf file) + copy of **source code** must be **handed in on WISEflow (see deadline on itslearning)**

- GitHub commits determine contribution
- Commits pushed after the deadline will not be taken into account.

By the deadline, the README should include:

- A link to a YouTube video demonstration of your game (~2min)
- Sources of any third party assets/code
- Optionally, a link to a playable WebGL build of your game, hosted on GitHub PagesClick
