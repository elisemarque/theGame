## Link to a playable WebGL build of your game hosted on GitHub PagesClick
We made the game with HDRP, but WebGL is not supported with HDRP.

## Recap

- [X] **70 hours per student**
- [X] The **scope/ambition** of the game
- [X] That you can demonstrate **ownership** of the implementation in your reflections
- [X] That the game covers the **learning goals** of the course
- [X] That the **source code is well-structured**
- [X] That the game is fully playable (it doesn’t have to be “bug-free”)
- [X] That it is **YOUR game** (not simply a copy/paste of a tutorial or a list of downloaded assets from the asset store)

- [X] Scripting (e.g. monobehaviours, coroutines, events)
- [X] Input & Vectors (e.g. input systems, manipulating transforms)
- [X] Physics (e.g. rigidbodies, colliders, triggers)
- [X] Graphics & Audio (e.g. models, shaders, audio clips)Animation (e.g. animators, animations)
- [X] Game Architecture (e.g. game managers, ScriptableObjects, SOLID principles)
- [X] Game AI (e.g. finite-state machines, navmesh agents, pathfinding algorithms)
- [X] User Interface (e.g. menus and HUD)

## Handing In (.zip)

Please find the PDF file in the GitHub repository and on WiseFlow.
